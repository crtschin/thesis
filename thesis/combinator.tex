\subsection{Combinator-Based Source Code Transformation}\label{sec:combinator-base}
  Eliott posed a novel and principled approach to defining an AD algorithm using \textit{category theory}\cite{Elliott-2018-ad-icfp}.
  They take the category theoretical hammer to the problem by approaching it as an algorithm on categories, cartesian closed categories \textit{(CCC)} to be exact, which are known to be equivalent to the simply-typed lambda calculi\cite{Elliott-2017-compiling-to-categories}\cite{10.1007/3-540-15198-2_10}.
  The algorithm is, however, still restricted to first order programs.

  An extension of this technique is given by \Vakar{}\cite{vkr2020reverse}.
  They go through first defining a small core combinator-based language.
  They then define a reverse-mode macro along with an additional auxiliary target language enriched with simple linear types.
