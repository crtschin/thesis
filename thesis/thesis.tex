\section{Formalizing Forward-Mode AD}\label{sec:forward}
  We will explain our formalization of the forward-mode automatic differentiation macro in the following sections.
  The formal proof will start from a base simply-typed lambda calculus extended with product types and incrementally add both sum and array types.
  Also included in the final language are natural number types with a primitive recursion principle.
  Many of the theorems and lemmas introduced in \cref{sec:formal_stlc} do not change, as they are independent of the specific types and terms included in the language.

\section{Towards Formalizing Reverse-Mode AD}\label{sec:rev}
  As mentioned in \cref{sec:related-work}, there have been many attempts at reverse-mode algorithms that operate on functional languages.
  These algorithms, however, either fall short as they make use of unconventional semantics such as mutable state or delimited continuations, or they do not perform true reverse-mode AD.
  Much of the problem with defining an efficient reverse-mode algorithm on functional languages comes from the difficulty with ensuring that fan-out, the various usages of a variable, in the forward pass, correctly transform to addition in the reverse pass.

  Eliott posed a novel and principled approach to defining an AD algorithm using \textit{category theory}\cite{Elliott-2018-ad-icfp}.
  They take the category theoretical hammer to the problem by approaching it as an algorithm on categories, Cartesian closed categories \textit{(CCC)} to be exact, which are known to be equivalent to the simply-typed lambda calculi\cite{Elliott-2017-compiling-to-categories}\cite{10.1007/3-540-15198-2_10}.
  The algorithm is, however, still restricted to first order programs.

  An extension of this technique is given by \Vakar{}\cite{vkr2020reverse}.
  They go through first defining a small core combinator-based language.
  They then define a reverse-mode macro along with an additional auxiliary target language enriched with simple linear types.
