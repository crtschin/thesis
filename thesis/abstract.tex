  In this research, we give a formalized proof of correctness of both a ubiquitous forward-mode and a continuation-based pseudo-reverse-mode automatic differentiation algorithms.
  We repeatedly do this using a logical relations argument accompanied with simple but effective language representations and denotations.
  We also discuss and prove sound various program transformations, which let forward-mode automatic differentiation approach the performance of reverse-mode.
  Finally, we make preliminary steps towards a formalized proof of correctness of a real combinator-based reverse-mode algorithm.
