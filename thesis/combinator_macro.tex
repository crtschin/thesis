\subsubsection{Defining the Macro and Target Language}\label{sec:combinator-macro}
  % TODO: work this in:
  % They make the observation that defining a reverse-mode algorithm requires the dual structures to the contraction and weakening rules usually implicitly present in structural languages.
  % These lead to the monoidal operations $\Gamma \vdash \synO : \tau$ and $\Gamma \vdash t_1 \synP t_2 : \tau$, where $\Gamma \vdash t_1, t_2 : \tau$.
  % Ensuring the higher-order types respect $(\synO, \synP)$ requires the usage of minimal linear types.
  % Notice that these two operations naturally correspond to, respectively, the zeroing and fan-out problems associated with reverse-mode AD.
