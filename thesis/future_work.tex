% TODO: non-termination and partiality are left out of the scope of this thesis.
% \<Coq> has very limited support for domain theoretical models.
% There are possible libraries which have resulted from experiments trying to encode domain theoretical models\cite{Benton2009}\cite{Dockins2014}, but these are incompatible with recent versions of \<Coq>.
