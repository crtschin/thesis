# Installation & Use

A number of Coq libraries was used:
- Coquelicot: Contains definitions for derivatives
- CoLoR: Contains useful vector definitions
- Equations: Dependent pattern matching a la Agda

I made liberal use of Unicode characters. My dev environment consisted of VSCode with the coq-linter and VSCoq extensions. The last of which is needed to use VSCode like a proper IDE for Coq. Lastly latex-input was used to input the Unicode symbols.
